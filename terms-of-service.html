                <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>

You may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works without our express written permission.</p>

                <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>The Service may integrate with or link to third-party services (e.g., Paystack, Google Play Store, Google AdSense). These third parties have their own terms and privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices. Your use of third-party services is at your own risk.</p>

                <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
                <p>The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

                <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Francis Pwavwe Production and its team members shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages — including loss of data, profits, or goodwill — arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

                <h2>11. Termination</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties, or for any other reason at our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. Provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>

                <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
